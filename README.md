# Data analysis repository

This repository contains source data and analysis code for a story published on
 <a href="http://trendct.org">TrendCT.org</a>. It may be too technical for the
average reader, but we make it accessible because we believe it is important to
 be as transparent as possible about our methodology so our work can be checked
 or expanded upon.
